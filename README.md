Hardhat contract development environment for [Etherbets](https://github.com/izcoser/etherbets).

Current work in progress available at: https://etherbets.org/

This is an archival reference branch for contract code used in my graduation project <em>Etherbets</em> at [Universidade Federal do Esp√≠rito Santo](https://ufes.br).

Further improvements will be on the develop or main branches.
