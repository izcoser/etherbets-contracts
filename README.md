Hardhat contract development environment for [Etherbets](https://github.com/izcoser/etherbets).

# To do

Create an aggregator contract. This contract will aggregate results from 2 or more ChainLINK sports data providers. One of them will be [TheRundown](https://market.link/nodes/TheRundown/integrations), the others are still to be decided.

The aggregator will be used to fetch sports data from 2 or more providers and output a definitive, more decentralized answer. This answer will be then forwarded to a bet contract and the result will be set according to the aggregated answer.
